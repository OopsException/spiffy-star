	<p>Bahaa started behind the bar like many do. As a barista, driven first by curiosity and then by a growing obsession with understanding coffee properly.
		What began as learning to pull consistent shots slowly evolved into a deeper interest in sourcing,
		roasting, flavor structure, and the culture built around the drink.</p>
	<p>Over the years, he worked in different cafés across Lebanon, learning from anyone willing to share knowledge, roasters, competitors, producers,
		old-school espresso guys, and the new generation of specialty brewers. What makes Bahaa stand out isn't just
		his skill; it's that he never stopped being a student of coffee.</p>
	<p>That drive eventually pushed him beyond Lebanon. In 2025 he traveled to China to train professionally and earned his Torch certification,
		spending time in coffee farms, processing stations, and with people who dedicate their lives to perfecting the craft.
		It changed how he sees coffee, not just as a drink, but as a community and a continuous conversation.</p>
	<p>Today, Bahaa is one of the most respected names in the local coffee scene. But if you ask him, he'll still tell you he's learning, experimenting, 
		and chasing the next insight. For him, coffee is about sharing knowledge, building community, and growing
		together. One cup at a time.</p>
